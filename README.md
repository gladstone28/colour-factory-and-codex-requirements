the Codex Alimentarius (established by the FAO and WHO) includes provisions for food additives such as natural food colors, though they are generally categorized under the broader umbrella of food additives rather than a separate category strictly labeled "natural colors."

What Codex Says About Natural Food Colors:
Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) â€“ CODEX STAN 192-1995
This is the main standard listing permitted food additives, including colors, for various food categories. It provides:

Names of color additives (e.g., Caramel, Paprika Extract, Beet Red, Curcumin, Annatto, etc.)

Their INS numbers (International Numbering System for Food Additives)

Maximum permitted levels in specific food categories

Functional classes (e.g., coloring agent)

Natural Colors Included in GSFA:
These include colorants derived from natural sources, such as:

Curcumin (INS 100) â€“ from turmeric

Annatto extracts (INS 160b) â€“ from Bixa orellana seeds

Beet red (INS 162) â€“ from red beet

Chlorophylls and chlorophyllins (INS 140, 141)

Carotenoids (INS 160a, 160c, 160d, etc.)

Paprika oleoresin (INS 160c)

Grape skin extract (INS 163(i))

Guidelines and Specifications:

Codex also refers to JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) evaluations and specifications for identity and purity.

Only additives evaluated and deemed safe by JECFA are typically listed in Codex GSFA.

Labelling Requirements:
Codex includes general labelling requirements (e.g., Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Food Additives Sold as Such â€“ CODEX STAN 107-1981) which may impact how natural colors are declared.
